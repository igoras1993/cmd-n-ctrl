Control node is a piece of hardware that directly controls devices. Most frequently
when I tell control node I mean Raspberry Pi that:

- Communicates directly with control center
- Collects data from sensors
- Controls endpoint devices such as LEDs, strips, fans,
- Serves as a proxy between control center and an endpoint device
